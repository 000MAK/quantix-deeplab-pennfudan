# DeepLabV3 Pedestrian Segmentation

Fine-tune a lightweight torchvision DeepLabV3 MobileNet model on the Penn-Fudan pedestrian dataset; downloads and safely extracts source data.

## Run

Use Python 3.10+ in a virtual environment; install `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run `python main.py --help` (or see project-specific command below). Dataset files, model weights and outputs are kept locally and ignored by Git.

Training code uses a fixed random seed/split and writes held-out metrics and model artifacts to `outputs/`.
## Dataset source

Downloads the Penn-Fudan pedestrian image and mask dataset from the [University of Pennsylvania project page](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/ped_html/).
